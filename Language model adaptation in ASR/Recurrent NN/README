Example of training and evaluation of rnnlm model on the Penn Treebank Corpus. If the
training takes more than 20 minutes, it would be good to check section 4 in FAQ.txt in
rnnlm directory (performance issues).
This information and the actual source code is available at http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/

THE CODE HERE IS SPECIFIC TO THE ADAPTATION OF BACKGROUND AND IN-DOMAIN DATA

The background data is divided into 25 smaller sets to allow parallel computation, and the code is designed accordingly.
For original samples/demos, visit the website listed above.
